      "about": "Founded in 2004, The Dukunde Kawa Cooperative (Musasa) cultivates its high-quality coffee near a mountain gorilla habitat in central Rwanda. The Dukunde Kawa Cooperative was established with the help from USAID’s SPREAD program that was dedicated to the development of specialty coffee in Rwanda. The cooperative became Fairtrade Organic certified in 2004.\n\nDukundu Kawa means “let’s love coffee” in Kinyarwanda.\n\nThe cooperative built their first washing station, Ruli, in 2003. To fund this, they received a development loan from the Rwandan government and support from the USAID-financed project PEARL. Initially, the cooperative grouped 300 coffee producers.  Dukunde Kawa built their second washing station, Mblima, with profits from the first washing station, in 2005. Nowadays, the cooperative has 4 washing stations in total, of which Musasa is the largest, to serve their more than 2100 members. 80% of contributing farmers are women. The cooperative is important to communities as an employer and as a community support system. Dukunde Kawa offers basket weaving projects, access to grain mills, a milk pasteurization facility, loans to producers for school fees and medical expenses as well as agricultural training.",
